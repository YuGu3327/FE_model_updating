# FE_model_updating
In short, this script is setting up, running, and processing the results of an ABAQUS simulation, and then comparing these results to experimental data. The script is designed to be used in an optimization loop, where the `parameter` input would be updated in each iteration to try and minimize the output of the `fitness` function
